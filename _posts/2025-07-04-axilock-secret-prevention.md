Picture this: You push code after a late-night sprint. Hours later, Slack is on fire - an AWS key slipped into your commit. Your cloud is exposed. Crypto miners are partying in your infrastructure. Scary?
It's not just you, 23.8 million secrets were leaked on public GitHub repositories in 2024 alone, a [25% year-over-year increase][1]. And the nightmare doesn't end there: 70% of secrets leaked two years ago are [still active today][2], leaving organizations dangerously exposed.

## Why Secret Leaks Are a Growing Crisis

* GitHub detected over [39 million leaked][6] secrets in 2024, including API keys, passwords, and tokens-despite new protections and scanning tools


* 15% of commit authors leaked a secret in [2024][1]. The problem isn't just with code; 6.1% of Jira tickets and 2.4% of Slack channels also exposed credentials, showing secrets sprawl across the entire software development lifecycle.

* The average, per incident, cost of a data breach is projected to reach [\$5 million in 2025][7], a significant increase over last year’s [\$4.45 million][8] - with lost business, detection, and remediation costs rising due to stricter regulations and increasingly complex attack surfaces.

## What Is Axilöck?

Axilöck is your ultimate line of defense against accidental secret leaks. It's a lightweight tool that installs directly on your dev machine, scanning every git push in real-time to block API keys, passwords, and sensitive data before they touch your VCS, be it GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure.

## Why Prevention Beats Detection

Traditional secret scanners work like burglar alarms after the robbery. When secrets leak, you're forced to:

1. Locate all the affected systems (2-7 days)
1. Rotate compromised credentials (2-24 hours)
1. Audit all systems for damage (2-5 days)
1. Halt development for cleanup (1-5 days)
1. The genie's already out of the bottle - damage control burns time, money, and your reputation (weeks to months)

Proactive, pre-push prevention is the only way to truly stop leaks before they happen - and that's exactly what Axilöck delivers.

## The Backstory

It started on a Friday, a developer accidentally pushed .env file to a public repo. The cleanup took weeks. Existing solutions required complex CI/CD pipelines or manual hooks – too slow for fast-paced teams.
We needed something pre-push, pre-disaster, something that gives us confidence on coverage so that we can focus on other things in life (including weekends).

## Designed for Devs, Trusted by Security Teams

* Zero friction: One command to install, no complex configs.
* Zero workflow disruption: No annoying false positives.
* Comprehensive coverage: Real-time metrics and anomaly detection ensure every developer and every commit is protected.
* Invisible armor: Axilöck runs locally, never sending your code to the cloud. Every push is scanned in milliseconds.
* Zero excuses: A 30-second install (``curl -sL https://get.axilock.ai | sh``) that just works.

## The Outcome

Axilöck isn’t just another dashboard metric - it's a prevention tool that lets security teams focus on what matters. No more editing ``.gitignore``, wrangling manual hooks, or worrying about coverage gaps.
Axilöck lets security teams shift their focus from **detecting to preventing**.

Join the **prevention** revolution !

    → Free Tier: Perfect for solo devs.
    → Team/Enterprise: SSO, Organization coverage metrics, custom integrations.

Get protected in 30 seconds:
